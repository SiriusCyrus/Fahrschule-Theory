## Road System and its Use

**When may you use the right-hand hard shoulder?**
- For driving a slow-moving vehicle.
- For stopping and parking.
 - ~~For overtaking.~~

**When driving on main roads, which vehicles must use the hard shoulders where possible?**
- Mopeds.
- ~~Small-engine motorcycles.~~
- Slow-moving agricultural tractors and machinery.

**You want to park on the right-hand side edge of the carriageway. How big is the mandatory minimum distance between your vehicle and the solid lane boundary line?**
- 3m.

**Which motor vehicles may freely choose their lane inside built-up areas?**
- All motor vehicles with a permissible total mass of up to 3.5t.

**You are driving on a road outside a built-up area with three lanes marked in each direction. Individual slower vehicles are travelling well-spaced out in the right-handed lane. Which lane may you use continuously?**
- ~~The left-hand lane.~~
- The middle lane.

**What must you anticipate with inclines on motorways?**
- Sudden overtaking maneuvers by other road users.
- Large differences in speed between vehicles.
- Slow-moving trucks on the right-hand lanes.

**What applies on clearways for motor vehicles only?**
- No U-turns.
- ~~In darkness, you may drive faster than the range of visibility allowed by dipped headlights.~~
- Join the clearway only at crossroads and junctions.

**You are driving in a merging lane. What should you do?**
- ~~Always drive to the end of the merging lane, pull up there and then enter lane.~~
- Drive past to the right of the slower-moving vehicles driving on the through-lane and merge in before them.
- Accelerate appropriately, do not pull up, if possible, merge while observing the right of way.

**You have been driving at high speed for some time. What effects can this have?**
- You lose your feel for speed.
- Your powers of concentration diminish.
- ~~The feel for the right speed on bend grows.~~

**When can strong side wind be particularly dangerous?**
- When overtaking trucks.
- When driving across bridges.
- When driving past firebreaks in forests.

**What must you be aware of when using navigation systems and road maps?**
- The contents may become outdated just a short time after purchase.
- ~~All navigation systems can update themselves automatically.~~
- Even up-to-date contents may differ from reality.

**Where are U-turns prohibited?**
- ~~On farm or forest tracks.~~
- On clearways for motor vehicles only.
- On motorways.

**What must you be aware of when joining the motorway?**
- On the merging lane, I may drive faster than the through-driving traffic.
- The through driving traffic has priority.
- ~~The through driving traffic on the right-hand lane must allow incoming traffic to merge.~~

**What is the recommended speed that applies to cars and motorcycles on autobahn?**
- 130kmph.

**On what roads does the recommended speed of 130kmph apply?**
- On vehicle roadways not inside a built-up area, with at least two marked lanes for each direction.
- Motorways.
- On vehicle roadways not inside a built-up area, with separate carriageways for each direction.

**When driving on motorways, why should you maintain the recommended speed of 130kmph?**
- Because this can prevent accidents occurring.
- Because this can reduce the severity of possible accidents.
- Because this achieves an even flow of traffic.

**What can result from driving for a long time at high speed?**
- You lose your feel for speed.
- ~~Your reactions improve.~~
- You drive too close to vehicles in front.

**You want to use an autobahn. To allow you to do so, what type-specific maximum speed must be entered in Part I of the registration certificate or in the operating license?**
- More than 60kmph.

**[What does this traffic sign indicate?](https://routetogermany.github.io/img/signs/4.%20Richtzeichen%20nach%20Anlage%203/Zeichen_467.1-20_-_Umlenkungspfeil_(Streckenempfehlung)_rechtsweisend,_StVO_2013.svg)**
- An autobahn section which is normally not used very much.
- ~~The place where the autobahn must be exited.~~
- ~~An obligatory diversion for vehicles with dangerous goods.~~

**A traffic jam has formed on a three-lane autobahn. Where must the channel for emergency vehicles be formed?**
- Between the left-hand and the middle lanes.
- ~~On the hard shoulder.~~
- ~~Between the middle and the right-hand lanes.~~

**How can you tell the shortest way to the next emergency telephone on federal motorways?**
- By the black arrows on the delineators.
- ~~By the direction markings on the guard rails.~~
- ~~By the ground markings on the hard shoulder.~~

**You are driving on the autobahn in light traffic. How long are you allowed to stay in the left-hand lane?**
- ~~All the time, provided no other vehicle wants to overtake you.~~
- As long as is necessary to overtake other vehicles.
- As long as you are driving behind a vehicle which is overtaking in the left-hand lane.

**What must you do if you find yourself in a traffic jam on motorways and on highways with two lanes travelling in the same direction?**
- I have to drive as far to the right as possible in the right-hand lane.
- I have to drive as far to the left as possible in the left-hand lane.
- ~~I have to drive as far to the left as possible in the right-hand lane~~

**You are driving at the recommended speed on the motorway and want to leave it at the next exit. What should you do?**
- I cease overtaking maneuvers in good time.
- I significantly reduce my speed on the exit lane.
- ~~I significantly reduce my speed while still on the right-hand lane of the motorway.~~

**After a longer journey travelling at about 120kmph, you want to exit the motorway. What must you be aware of when doing so?**
- I check the speedometer to make sure I donâ€™t underestimate my speed.
- I signal in good time and then brake while on the exit lane, so as not to impede the traffic behind me.
- ~~I maintain my speed while on the exit lane, so as not to impede the traffic behind me.~~

**You are driving on the motorway and have missed the exit. What is the right course of action?**
- ~~I stop on the hard shoulder t plan my subsequent route.~~
- I continue driving and leave the motorway at one of the next exits.
- ~~I reverse back on the hard shoulder, because the exit is less than 100m behind me.~~
